		Declaring a bean
		There can be so many beans, so to identify them uniquely, we have to provide them a id
		we also have to specify the bean class

		<!-- The property tag, can be used for fields in the bean, 
			the value tag, initialzes the bean with specified value
			The property tag, sets the property value through the setter method

			<value>Hello Spring!</value>

		<!-- 
			If we write both, I mean property and constructor-arg tag
			Then,  obviously, first the constructor will be called, that means construcctor-arg will initialize it's value
			and then the setter will set the value
